        <h2>September 17, 2024</h2>
        <p>Today we worked on determining the dimensions of the robot. We used what we have learned from previous classes to make sure that everything was the right size to be successful. We also worked had a group working on constructing the playfield so that we can test our robot when it is completed. We also began CAD and had a group working on the marketing presentation as well as our exhibit.</p>
        <h2>September 13, 2024</h2>
        <p>On this day we finalized our design. We split discussed general ideas as a class then split into groups to maximize our time. One group revised our scoring strategy to minimize the distance traveled, lowering the speed our robot needs to travel at.  Another group worked on further revising our new design, and a third group began creating some basic parts for testing. We left class with the goal to begin creating dimensions over the weekend. </p>

        <h2>September 11, 2024</h2>
        <p>On this day we ordered parts for the exhibit and playfield construction. We also further discussed our robot design and found many flaws. We ended up scrapping our original arm design in favor of adding a scooping mechanism. We decided that this would be necessary to be successful with our scoring strategy. However we struggled to find a way to keep an arm for other tasks, and use a scooper. All of the designs we came up with that would likely be successful used more motors than we are provided in the competition. Ultimately we decided to have everyone go home and come up with new designs.  </p>
        <h2>September 9, 2024</h2>
        <p>This was the first class period following the launch of the competition. We discussed our scoring strategy and discussed the robot designs that each team member created over the weekend. We then split into 3 specific groups to continue brainstorming. One group brainstormed the base of the robot, one brainstormed the arm of the robot and the other brainstormed the exhibit. By the end of the class we had a few solid ideas and exhibit was fairly mapped out.  </p>
        <h2>September 7, 2024</h2>
        <p>Sean, Tyler, and Isaiah met at Kroger on the day of the release to discuss the scoring strategy.</p>

        <h2>September 6, 2024</h2>
        <p>	At this point, all our parts were sorted. We came up with some potential exhibit designs during class.
             We also discussed our plan following the start of the competition. 
             We decided that each team member would come to class with two potential robot designs, 
             and three area specific designs. </p>

        <h2>September 3, 2024</h2>
        <p>By this day most of our sponsorship emails were drafted or sent. We primarily focused on finishing the sorting of the consumables list.
             We also discussed immediate roles after the competition launches the weekend of September 7th-8th.</p>
        <h2>August 30, 2024</h2>
        <p>On this day we continued sorting parts, marking whichever parts we were missing to be purchased. We also had a group brainstorm
             for sponsorship and developed a sponsorship form and assigned students to reach out based on their connection to the sponsors. Laci also brainstormed some logo ideas.</p>

        <h2>August 27, 2024</h2>
        <p>Today we began looking through past consumables lists, a list of materials we can use to build our robot. We then began sorting the parts we had from previous years to fill two kits worth of material. This proved to be a very extensive task. We also began discussing the total cost we would be facing and potential sponsorship ideas. </p>
        <h2>August 23, 2024</h2>
        <p>Today we determined how we would organize our team. We grouped the project into different sections and assigned roles within each section. As a team we decided to give each section a team lead. These people would ensure that all necessary tasks are being completed in their groups and help to resolve conflicts. Everyone left class today with an understanding of their roles and what would be expected of them going forward. </p>
        <h2>August 21, 2024</h2>
        <p>On this day we began to organize our team. We began by establishing group norms. These norms will help us as we get into the competition. Group norms establish rules, resolve conflicts, and ensure equal workload among team members. We spent much of our class time discussing norms to ensure everyone has a say in how our team will be run and the expectations we will hold. We also began to look at the typical roles that are needed leading up to and during the competition. We filled out an online form to decide what roles most interest us.  </p>

        <h2>August 13-19, 2024</h2>
        <p>During the first two weeks of school, we were introduced to the BEST robotics competition. We spent most of the class learning about the competition. Our teacher explained the different sections, the general rules, and how our school has done in the past. As a class, we discussed what led to past classes' success and the things that held back previous classes. We did this to learn from their mistakes and build off their success. During this time, we also voted on team leads, Elena and Hunter were voted to take the roles.</p>
