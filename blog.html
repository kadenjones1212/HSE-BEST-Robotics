    <h2>November 1, 2024</h2>
    <p>This is the last day before the competition, we added all of the final touches to the robot, and all drivers
        spent time practicing on our playfield. We also packed everything up to be put on the bus in the morning.
        Everyone left today optimistic for the competition on Saturday!</p>
    <h2>October 28,2024</h2>
    <p>At the end of the day today we had a fully functioning robot. We still needed to adjust a few things in order to
        make things run smoother, but for the most part everything was working. Our exhibit team continued to run
        through the exibit presentation as well. We began quickly making a new robot with all of the same features as
        the first. This robot would be spraypainted to match our team aesthetic. </p>
    <h2>October 25, 2024</h2>
    <p>We began taking apart our robot in order to print a new base piece, we also got the Dump system to work. Around
        half way through the day we decided to switch gears and work on making sure our engineering notebook was up to
        date with all of our CAD drawings. We plan to finish up the enginnering notebook on Saturday and submit it
        before the deadline.</p>
    <h2>October 24, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today was a very busy work day, we had many of our teammates stay after school to work on everything. Exhibit is
        nearly finished and marketing team has a lot of revisions after yesterday. We tested the Dump system and found
        that it wasnt falling farr enough to dump the moon rocks. We also got further on the arm assemblie and decided
        that we need to remake the base for more strength and to fix some small issues. This was very successful in
        discovering everything we need to change. </p>
    <h2>October 23, 2024</h2>
    <p>Several of the class members showed up at 7:30 AM to work on the project. The claw was completed, and the base
        was almost finished until an issue was found and we had to redo the arm tower. At 10:00 am, Mann Properties came
        in to review the Marketing team's presentation.</p>

    </video>
    <h2>October 22, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today was our second day back from fall break. We had a practice presentation for our marketing and exhibit teams
        which was very insightful for those groups. We also worked on the robot, we reprinted some of the arm pieces on
        the laser, and worked on fixing the drive train for the wheels as well. Overall it was a very successful day of
        work. </p>
    <h2>October 16, 2024</h2>
    <p>This week was fall break. However our team decided to have one day where the lab was open to work on our project.
        Not everyone could make it but this day was very beneficial for our playfield and robot construction. On this
        day the playfield was fully finished. We made many changed to the robot base design and began putting this
        together. Overall this extra day of work really helped to keep us on track for the competition. </p>
    <img src="media/blogEntries/October 14th Full Playfield Assembled Photo.jpg" height="300">
    <h2>October 10, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today was PSAT day for Freshman, Sophomores, and Juniors at the school. Luckily everyone in our class is a
        Senior, so we all decided to come in at noon and work until 3pm, with some people staying even later. This was a
        very crucial block of work time, and we got a lot done. All of the Playfield pieces have now been cut, and the
        Playfield is nearly fully assembled. As for the robot, we got all of the new base pieces created and have begun
        the process of assembling them again. Once we get this tested, we will move on to create the arm of the robot.
    </p>

    <h2>October 9, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today we got the entire base of the robot assembled and attempted to drive it. It worked great when driving on
        flat surfaces but when we attempted to simulate the terrain of the playfield, we discovered that the robot
        begins to slide when it reaches the top of a hill. This was a very large issue. We decided to change quite a bit
        of our wheel design, scrapping the omni wheel altogether. We assigned a group to work on fixing this design so
        that we could start creating the new parts next class.</p>

    <h2>October 5, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today many of our group members attended the Fall-A-Palooza. This was a super fun event where we got to gain
        potential sponsors and advertise our team. On top of this we also got to meet many of the kids at the middle
        school, and teach them about our class, engineering, the competition, and much more. This was an amazing
        opportunity to connect with our community!</p>

    <h2>October 3, 2024</h2>
    <p>In class today, we took a picture of our team for our website and social media. We also worked to make sure that
        everything was in place for the Fall-A-Palooza, a local community gathering. On top of this we decided to move
        back the day that we would present our robot to our teacher, due to him being absent for a few class periods,
        slowing down our working process. We also made the decision to have something that drives by the end of next
        week.</p>

    <h2>October 1, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today was another workday, the engineering notebook still needed quite a bit of work, so we decided to continue
        with engineering notebook at-home assignments. At this point the playfield and exhibit were starting to look
        pretty good. Those on exhibit put in a lot of effort to make sure we have a good station at the fall palooza on
        October 5th. The robot build was still just beginning but with nearly all of the CAD files completed it is
        looking promising.</p>

    <p>Today was an E-learning day through our school. For this class we decided that we would work on CAD and
        engineering notebook assignments. Each person had different responsibilities, but the goal was to make sure we
        stayed on top of all parts of the competition and didn’t put things like our research paper and engineering
        notebook at the bottom of the priority list. This day was very beneficial and allowed us to spend the majority
        of our in-school class time working on the construction of the playfield, exhibit, and robot.</p>

    <h2>September 25, 2024</h2>
    <p>On this day we continued working on robot build, and playfield build. Kaden got majority of the omni wheel
        constructed, and many other pieces were cut by other team members. At this point most of CAD was done with the
        exception of the main assembly. We decided to assign engineering notebook assignments for every team member for
        the weekend. This was done to make sure that we are staying on top of our documentation as we progress
        throughout the competition. We also had a very successful day of exhibit build.</p>

    <h2>September 23, 2024</h2>
    <p>In class we worked on creating more of the robot parts. We also added more people to the playfield construction
        team. The playfield is very large this year and we want to make sure that we have a place to test our robot once
        it is created. We also decided that any leftover CAD needs to be finished outside of class. We also discussed an
        opportunity to visit a Junior High and display our progress and our goals.</p>

    <h2>September 19, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today we worked a lot on the CAD for our robot. Elena set the goal deadline of Sunday at midnight for all CAD. We
        knew this would be a difficult deadline to hit but we also knew that we need the CAD to be complete to begin the
        build of the robot. There were also groups working on playfield build, exhibit, and marketing presentation.</p>

    <h2>September 17, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today we worked on determining the dimensions of the robot. We used what we have learned from previous classes to
        make sure that everything was the right size to be successful. We also worked had a group working on
        constructing the playfield so that we can test our robot when it is completed. We also began CAD and had a group
        working on the marketing presentation as well as our exhibit.</p>

    <h2>September 13, 2024</h2>
    <p>On this day we finalized our design. We split discussed general ideas as a class then split into groups to
        maximize our time. One group revised our scoring strategy to minimize the distance traveled, lowering the speed
        our robot needs to travel at. Another group worked on further revising our new design, and a third group began
        creating some basic parts for testing. We left class with the goal to begin creating dimensions over the
        weekend. </p>

    <h2>September 11, 2024</h2>
    <p>On this day we ordered parts for the exhibit and playfield construction. We also further discussed our robot
        design and found many flaws. We ended up scrapping our original arm design in favor of adding a scooping
        mechanism. We decided that this would be necessary to be successful with our scoring strategy. However we
        struggled to find a way to keep an arm for other tasks, and use a scooper. All of the designs we came up with
        that would likely be successful used more motors than we are provided in the competition. Ultimately we decided
        to have everyone go home and come up with new designs. </p>

    <h2>September 9, 2024</h2>
    <p>This was the first class period following the launch of the competition. We discussed our scoring strategy and
        discussed the robot designs that each team member created over the weekend. We then split into 3 specific groups
        to continue brainstorming. One group brainstormed the base of the robot, one brainstormed the arm of the robot
        and the other brainstormed the exhibit. By the end of the class we had a few solid ideas and exhibit was fairly
        mapped out. </p>

    <h2>September 7, 2024</h2>
    <p>Sean, Tyler, and Isaiah met at Kroger on the day of the release to discuss the scoring strategy.</p>

    <h2>September 6, 2024</h2>
    <p> At this point, all our parts were sorted. We came up with some potential exhibit designs during class.
        We also discussed our plan following the start of the competition.
        We decided that each team member would come to class with two potential robot designs,
        and three area specific designs. </p>

    <h2>September 3, 2024</h2>
    <p>By this day most of our sponsorship emails were drafted or sent. We primarily focused on finishing the sorting of
        the consumables list.
        We also discussed immediate roles after the competition launches the weekend of September 7th-8th.</p>

    <h2>August 30, 2024</h2>
    <p>On this day we continued sorting parts, marking whichever parts we were missing to be purchased. We also had a
        group brainstorm
        for sponsorship and developed a sponsorship form and assigned students to reach out based on their connection to
        the sponsors. Laci also brainstormed some logo ideas.</p>

    <h2>August 27, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today we began looking through past consumables lists, a list of materials we can use to build our robot. We then
        began sorting the parts we had from previous years to fill two kits worth of material. This proved to be a very
        extensive task. We also began discussing the total cost we would be facing and potential sponsorship ideas. </p>

    <h2>August 23, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today we determined how we would organize our team. We grouped the project into different sections and assigned
        roles within each section. As a team we decided to give each section a team lead. These people would ensure that
        all necessary tasks are being completed in their groups and help to resolve conflicts. Everyone left class today
        with an understanding of their roles and what would be expected of them going forward. </p>

    <h2>August 21, 2024</h2>
    <p>On this day we began to organize our team. We began by establishing group norms. These norms will help us as we
        get into the competition. Group norms establish rules, resolve conflicts, and ensure equal workload among team
        members. We spent much of our class time discussing norms to ensure everyone has a say in how our team will be
        run and the expectations we will hold. We also began to look at the typical roles that are needed leading up to
        and during the competition. We filled out an online form to decide what roles most interest us. </p>

    <h2>August 13-19, 2024</h2>
    <p>During the first two weeks of school, we were introduced to the BEST robotics competition. We spent most of the
        class learning about the competition. Our teacher explained the different sections, the general rules, and how
        our school has done in the past. As a class, we discussed what led to past classes' success and the things that
        held back previous classes. We did this to learn from their mistakes and build off their success. During this
        time, we also voted on team leads, Elena and Hunter were voted to take the roles.</p>
