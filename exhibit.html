<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The HSE Best Robotics exhibit is inspired by the International Space Station and other spacecrafts. </p>
<h2>Exterior Design</h2>
<p>The exhibit is mainly colored white with other designs like student-made solar panels, and student painted items. The curved roof of the exhibit is to make the exterior feel less boxy, just like how the ISS is round. On the roof of the exhibit, there is a student-made satellite dish to represent the many satellites on the ISS. Also waiting for you is Roary, the mascot of HSE. </p>
<h2>Interior Design</h2>
<p>The interior is mainly white with lights that arenâ€™t too bright, like inside the ISS. On the sides of the walls and the ceiling, there are student painted windows that are painted to represent looking out to space. Hanging from the ceiling there are company sponsors that are on everyday objects, that have been recycled, like mugs, cans, and other items to represent low gravity just like in the ISS and space. Also, on the floors and the sides, there are different colored strings to represent loose wiring. (Insert Interactive Piece Once We Have It Thought Of). In the back of the exhibit, all hub and national logos, and sponsors are displayed. Also, in the back of the exhibit, on a table trifolds will display the journey HSE Best Robotics has gone through to get to be here. </p>
